## Project Background 
City General Hospital is experiencing severe operational issues: ER overcrowding, bed 
misallocation, staff burnout, medication mismanagement, financial losses, and high lab retest 
rates. This project analyzes available hospital data and produces an interactive Excel dashboard 
with actionable recommendations. --- 
## Project Objective - Identify root causes of ER congestion and resource waste   - Analyze patient flow, staff workload, medication stock, lab efficiency, and finance data   - Build an interactive Excel dashboard to inform board-level decisions   - Recommend prioritized actions to stabilize hospital operations --- 
## Datasets 
- **Patients.csv / Patients.xlsx** — patient_id, age, gender, visit_date, department, --- 
## Dashboard Features - Key KPIs: total patients,   - Visuals: time-series of visits, age-group distributions, staff workload heatmap, stock expiry 
chart, departmental revenue breakdown   - Interactivity: slicers/filters for Department, Date range, Age group, Staff role, Medication type --- 
## Key Findings (example) - Majority of ER visits are from elderly patients → contributes to bed shortages   - Uneven staff distribution: some departments overloaded while others idle   - Inventory mismatch: critical drugs short while others near expiry   - 15% of lab tests flagged for retest, increasing workload and delays   - Revenue leakage from unpaid insurance claims and billing gaps --- 
## Recommendations 
1. Reallocate beds and triage protocols based on age-group trends   
2. Rebalance staff shifts using workload analytics and consider cross-training   
3. Implement automated stock monitoring & FIFO for medications   
4. Tighten lab QC processes to reduce retests (target <5%)   
5. Audit billing and implement a claims follow-up workflow to reduce unpaid claims   
6. Monitor KPIs weekly and run a monthly operational review with stakeholders --- 
## Tools & Techniques - Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Slicers)   - Data cleaning and transformation in Excel   - Dashboard layout and visualization best practices   - Basic descriptive analytics and KPI design --- 
## Project Files (included) - `Dashboard.xlsx` — interactive dashboard file   - `/datasets/` — raw data files used for analysis (CSV / XLSX)   - `Presentation.pdf` — boardroom slide deck (10–12 slides)   - `README.md` — this documentation --- 
## How to Run / View 
1. Open `Dashboard.xlsx` in Excel (desktop recommended)   
2. Enable content (if prompted) to allow Pivot Tables and slicers to work   
3. Use slicers to filter by Department, Date, Age group, etc.   
4. Refer to `Presentation.pdf` for a summary of insights and recommended actions ---
